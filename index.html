            <h1>About me</h1>
            I’m a Software Engineering student with a strong focus on Back-End Development, where logic, structure, and reliability matter most.</br>
            I <b>only</b> build clean, maintainable systems and solve real-world problems through code.</br>

            I have hands-on experience with Python through academic and personal projects, and I’m currently advancing my skills through a Back-End MicroBachelors program.</br>

            I learn fast, write with intention, and constantly push myself to grow as a Software Engineer.</br>
            I don’t just write code — I build foundations.

            <a href="https://github.com/Ahmad-Alsawalhi/MiNote" id="MiNote">MiNote</a> is a simple yet functional command-line program that allows users to write their own notes,edit them, and create structured “Activities Lists” (to-do lists) that can help inspire productivity and goal achievement.The application is designed to make note-taking quick and easy through a clear and minimal interface that runs entirely in the terminal. The purpose of this project is to build a fully functional,user-friendly note-taking application that works completely from the command line, without the need for any graphical interface or external tools. It was created as part of the final project requirement for CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python), and it showcases how much can be done using only Python’s built-in features.The application is built using Python’s standard library only, except for one external library used solely for testing purposes.All data is stored persistently in plain text files.

            <a href="https://github.com/Ahmad-Alsawalhi/Enhanced-MiNote" id="EnhancedMiNote">Enhanced MiNote</a> MiNote is a simple yet functional Python application that allows users to write personal notes, edit them, and create structured “To-Do Lists” (Activities Lists) to help increase productivity and track goals. The application is designed to make note-taking quick and easy through a clear and minimal graphical interface built with Tkinter, which runs entirely in Python without any external libraries.

This project was created as part of a learning project in Python, demonstrating how much can be done using only Python’s standard features. All data is stored persistently in plain text files inside the MiNote/ folder, ensuring that users’ notes and to-do lists are saved and accessible across sessions.
